# Design Patterns and Principles 
## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
SPR states that "A class should have only one reason to change". In other words, each class in a software should handle single responsibility from the set of functionalities provided by the software. It increase cohesion and loose coupling of the software. SRP also enables you to follow the Separation of Concerns Principle (SCP). SCP states that a program should be broken down into distinct parts where each part addresses a specific concern or set of information that affects the program. That is, high-level business logic should not concern on the low-level implementation.
### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
LSP states that "Drive types must be substitutable for their base types". That means, if a class is inheriting from a base class, then the reference to the base class can be replaced with the derived class reference without affecting the functionality of the program. LSP is an extension of the OCP. In other words, If class A is a subtype of class B, instance of class B should be replacable with instance of class A without affecting the existing behavior of the program.
##### Implementation Guidelines
- Subtypes should not thow new exceptions unless they are part of the existing exception hierarchy.
- Clients should not know which specific subtype they are calling. The client should behave the same regardless of the subtype instance that is given.
- New derived classes should just extend the existing classes without replacing the functionality of old classes.

### Open /Closed Principle (OCP)
OCP states that "Software entities such as classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension, but closed for modification".
That means, any new functionality should be implemented by adding new classes, attributes, or methods by driving from the original class instead of changing the current ones or existing ones. **Strategy pattern** helps us to follow the OCP.
##### Implementation Guidelines
- Implement the new functionality on new derived classes
- Allow clients to access the original class with an abstract interface.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
ISP states that no client should be forced to implement a method in an interface that it doesnâ€™t use. If the clent does not have any reason to use the method, the class should not be forced to implement it. So, break down the big interface into smaller interfaces.
##### Implementation Guidelines
- No client should be forced to implement methods that it does not use them.
- Instead of one big interface break it down into small interfaces based on groups of methods with related functionalities.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
DIP "High-level modules or classes of a software should not depend on low-level modules or classes. Instead both of them should depend on abstractions." That means, details should depend on abstractions but not vice versa. In other words, the high-level and low-level classes or modules should interact through abstractions or interfaces.
## Design Patterns
Design patterns are reusable solutions to recurring problems in the domain of software design. Some of the commonly occurring problems in the software development life cycle are:
- Creation and disposal of objects -> creational pattern
- Interaction between objects -> behavioral pattern
- Structure of classes -> which is the structural pattern
  - This enhances cohesion and loose coupling, maintainability

### Creational Pattern
Creational patterns help to solve the problem of object creation and initialization by abstracting the way of object creation and initialization process. It hides the object creation logic by avoiding instantiation of objects directly using the new operator.
1. **Singleton Pattern**
Provides a solution on how to create a class that has only one instance across the whole application.
**Implementation guidelines**:
- Make sure that only one instance of a class exists
- Declare the constructor of the class with private access modifier
- The Singleton instance should be stored in a private static field.
- Provide public static method that returns a reference to the Singleton instance 
  - That is provide a single point of access to the Singleton instance
- Make sure the Singleton instance is thread safe

### Behavioral Pattern
Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction between objects and how they communicate with each other. It helps to define the way of communication between objects in a flexible and reusable way.
1. **Strategy Pattern**
The Strategy pattern allows us to change object behaviors at runtime. Moreover, it plays a significant role in the composition over inheritance way of thinking and is the backbone of dependency injection.
The Strategy pattern aims to extract a strategy from the host class that needs it (the context or consumer). That allows the consumer to decide on the strategy to use at runtime.
